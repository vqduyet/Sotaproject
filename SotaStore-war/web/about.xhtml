                        <h1>BACK STORY</h1>
                        <p>As the mother of four athletic boys, Sota had to figure out a way to get them to eat their veggies while staying healthy. Because serving a dressing full of artificial ingredients was not an option, she created and perfected her own all-natural recipe. When her oldest son, Phuong, realized how great it was, he said, “Mom, let’s go into business together and make this for the world!” As Sota's All Natural grows its product line around the globe, the commitment to healthy eating and healthy living remains the core of the company's mission.</p>
